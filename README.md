# About 
This repo is a remake of a Hyperskill project **Easy Riders Bus Company** written in `C++`.
This program takes in a JSON-like file which is a representation of a bus company database. The file contains an array of JSON objects representing timetable units. The data contains different kinds of errors, including wrong type, wrong format and logical errors in the schemes of bus lines. The program finds all the mistakes in the database and print the output.
